# AHK Scripts

Scripts I made for **A**uto**H**ot**K**ey.

## Scripts

**All scripts provided below require [AutoHotkey v2!](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/releases/latest)**

- [**`VCheck.ahk`**](./Scripts/VCheck.ahk) - A simple version checker script for AutoHotkey, as they still have not yet implemented this.

- [**`Acromplete.ahk`**](./Scripts/Acromplete.ahk) - A simple script that auto-completes the common acronyms you write. It has to be in the background for this to work!
